# Agentic Based Capture the Flag Challenge (CTF) 2025
A collection of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and solutions focused on adversarial machine learning and cybersecurity.
Agentic-based CTF - using LLMs such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude to find vulnerabilities in programs.

## 📁 Repository Contents

- **`Lab3.ipynb`** - Main CTF challenge notebook with adversarial ML attacks
- **`Practice1.ipynb`** - Practice exercises and warm-up challenges
- **`Practice5.ipynb`** - Other practice problems
- **`agent.py`** - AI agent implementation for automated exploitation
- **`ctf_pwn.py`** - PWN challenge exploitation scripts

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install jupyter numpy pandas torch scikit-learn
```

### Running the Challenges
```bash
# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

# Open any .ipynb file to begin
```

## 🎯 Challenge Categories

## 📝 Additionals

Manual solutions for solving the challenges and walkthroughs are included in the notebooks. 
Also, remember to set up your own API keys.

## Finals

The Finals involved two challenges: follow the pwnie and Sharpgames.

Follow the pwnie involved finding the file that contains the correct flag, extract the content and print you have won.
Sharp games -> involved
